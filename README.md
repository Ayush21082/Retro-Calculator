## Introduction ##
Our Calculator app is a fun and functional tool for all your calculating needs. With a retro theme, it boasts vintage colors, fonts, and graphics that will transport you back in time. Inspired by classic calculators, this app includes all the features you need for basic math, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. But it doesn't stop there - I'm also working on advanced functions such as square roots, exponents, and more. Whether you're solving equations for work or school, or just want to add a touch of nostalgia to your phone, our Calculator app has you covered.
